= 00 â€¢ Migrating the Laptop to Linux Mint 21.3
:toc:
:icons: font

NOTE: Windows 11 was originally installed on my ASUS ROG Strix laptop. I decided to switch to Linux Mint 21.3 (Cinnamon edition) because it's user-friendly and visually similar to Windows.  
I considered dual booting but ultimately chose to fully switch to Linux. I also changed my default browser to Firefox to align more with open-source. This is of course not necessary for the lab itself.

== Install at a glance

. Backed up all personal files to my external hard drive (Seagate Portable Drive).

. Created a full system backup using the free version of Macrium Reflect: https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree  
  The backup image was also saved to my Seagate drive.

. Downloaded the ISO for Linux Mint 21.3 Cinnamon: https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=319

. Used Rufus to write the ISO to a USB stick and create a bootable installer: https://rufus.ie/fr/

. On a separate USB (rescue USB):  
+
Opened *Macrium Reflect* and went to **Other Tasks > Create Rescue Media** to create the rescue environment on a flash drive.  
In case of an issue: boot from the rescue USB, plug in the Seagate drive, select the Windows 11 image, and restore the system.
